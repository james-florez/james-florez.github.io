# About Me

Hi! My name is James Florez and I am a engineer with varied professional interests.
I recieved a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from UCLA but while I was there I also completed a year's worth of courses in the Computer Science major. Currently I am applying to graduate schools hoping to complete a M.S. in Computer Science.


I am currently working as a Mechanical Design Engineer in the Aerospace industry and am excited about the new changes coming to this industry with the adoption of advanced systems with integrated software.
